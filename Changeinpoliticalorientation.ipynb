These events could have a significant impact on shifts in political orientation (such as the attempted assassination of Trump) but fall outside our primary areas of investigation. Identifying these events is crucial to avoid mistakenly attributing observed changes in political orientation to our primary event, when they might instead be influenced by these other high-impact occurrences.\n",

Next, it determines a two-week interval centered around the date of our target event. Using the EventRegistry, it then searches for other events occurring within this interval that have a higher article count. Events for which no higher article count is found within this period are added to a new list, solo_big_events_energy, and are printed to the console."
